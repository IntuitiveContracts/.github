## Operational Processes
-----------------
### How do customers replace batteries?

**With Coverage in a Click**
Customers can replace batteries by simply clicking one of the following links:
- [Coverage in a Click - Lifetime vehicle coverage](https://www.coverageinaclick.com/)
- [Get Coverage in a Click - Fast and Easy Insurance Quotes](https://www.coverageinaclick.com/getCoverage)

By entering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), customers can proceed to a three-step checkout process, allowing them to enjoy a lifetime of battery coverage within one minute.

**Without Coverage in a Click**
Without Coverage in a Click, vehicle owners will rely on the limited coverage and warranties provided by the manufacturer. This may result in additional costs for recurrent and atypical battery repairs, as well as the need to visit specialized dealerships with poor customer service.

### How do the dealership and customers validate the coverage?

**With Coverage in a Click**
Dealerships can validate the coverage for any vehicle by accessing the battery coverage contract within the Coverage in a Click or LodeStar Re (Coverage Administrator)
